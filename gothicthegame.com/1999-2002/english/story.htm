          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With a
              surge of desperation and your last ounce of strength you endeavour to
              break free from the mean grip of the guards at your sides, constantly
              trying to haul you forwards. Just a few more steps from the edge. You
              dig your feet into the dirt, to stop these brutes bringing you any closer.
              The guard to your left, his long, black hair, wet with sweat, clinging
              to your face, wheezes into your ear " It's time to meet the other side".</font>
          </p>

                height="200" align="left" hspace="10">With
              mighty hands he grabs your arm and your shoulder, kicking at the backs
              of your knees with his heavy boots, lessening your defence. The rogue
              to your right starts to tear at your arm with malicious laughter. You
              look up. On the other side of the cliff you see the enormous shimmering
              dome, that you saw from afar, now towering above you. Stunned, you stand
              gaping at the vastness of the barrier, frozen in a moment of horror.
              Long enough for the guards to cut through your defence completely. The
              black-haired brute to your left forces your legs from underneath you
              and they drag you to the edge of the cliff on your knees. The dark humming
              hardly noticeable before, is now clearer and louder. At the centre of
              the dome you see something similar to a village. Smoke rises from the
              small huts dotted around the land. There, beside the rocks is something
              that looks like the entrance to a mine.....</font>

                height="200" align="right">"Stand
              him up" booms a voice behind you, the "Royal Judge". The two guards
              quickly drag you up. Stretching your neck to see behind you, you can
              only catch a glimpse of the tall man. "Prisoner! For your misdeeds our
              king to slave-work in the iron-ore mines sentences you. Here you will
              stay till the end of your miserable days! Guards....." From the corner
              of your eye you see the tall figure raise his hand. Wriggling wild and
              furious you strive to escape the strong hold of the two guards, finding
              of a sudden new strength in the will to live. A powerful kick to your
              back and you're free from the guards hold and falling over the edge........
              plunging down toward the barrier, you fling your arms up to soften the
              impact but there was none, just a strange sensation as you pass through
              the hazy green light ..... You fall further and further getting closer
              and closer to the ground. No! There's water, underneath you... Your
              screams are silenced as you hit the surface of cool water. Lack of strength
              leaves you no other option but to let yourself float to the surface...
              AIR!</font>
          </p>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You see
              the blurred outlines of the shore. Slowly, with little strength left,
              you swim towards land and drag yourself gasping onto the muddy sand.
              You see through half closed eyes, a heavy foot in the mud in front of
              your face, you look up... more than one! Prisoners in ragged cloth and
              rotted pieces of armour unmoving, glaring, with folded arms, one hefty
              ruffian bends down to you, pulls up your head by your hair and spits
              at you with rotten breath: "Welcome to jail !"</font>

                World of GOTHIC</b></font>
          </p>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">War sweeps
              throughout the kingdom. Hoards of orcs invading the land from the North.
              In order to keep the royal army going the blacksmiths of the land strive
              constantly over their hot coals replenishing weapons and forging new
              ammunition. Those who break the law in these days are punished hard;
              they are sent in to slavery in the mines, to delve deep into the earth
              and dig out ORE for weapons.</font>
          </p>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are
              no guards here, there is no need: The entire mining area is surrounded
              by a magical barrier, this dome is a thousand metres in diameter and
              stretches over the prison reaching through the underground and meeting
              to a perfect sphere in the depths of the mines.</font>
          </p>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The barrier
              can be passed from the outside with no effect whatsoever. No living
              being can pass through from the inside however, only lifeless objects.
              In this way the prisoners have the monthly opportunity to exchange the
              ore for food, medicine, even drugs and small luxuries, with the world
              outside. </font>

                height="200" align="right">Within
              the prison there is a callous hierarchy, only the most powerful of prisoners
              are allowed to receive goods from the outside world and only they have
              the right to share it among the others. The strong take a huge amount
              for themselves and live in luxury, the others are made to grind in the
              mines day after day for their miserable share.</font>
          </p>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The penal
              colony has two rival groups. On one side: The old encampment, under
              the authority of the ore barons who control most of the exchange between
              the prison and the outside world, on the other; the smaller, new encampment,
              where the inhabitants are runaways from the other side who have opened
              their own mine and work desperately on a breakout plan.</font>
          </p>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other than
              that, there is a somewhat remote temple, whose leaders rant and rave
              their prophecies of the end of the world. Together with the younger
              members, they constantly celebrate the few days they think they have
              left. The temple and the new camp have joined together against the old
              camp and the power of each is more or less equal. </font>
          </p>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every now
              and then there are some attacks and small hold ups between the two sides,
              for more extensive assaults neither of the two are powerful enough.
              Both sides however, keep constant watch over the other in case of some
              otherwise unknown weak point that would aid them in their fight against
              each other. </font>
          </p>
          <p>
            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This twisted
              predicament is not your problem, it is just one of them.</font>
