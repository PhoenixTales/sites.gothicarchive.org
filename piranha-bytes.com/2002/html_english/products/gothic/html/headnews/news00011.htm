                        GameOn's first edition granted us a rating of </small><small>1.8
                      and the award "Top Of Game On!". Thus we have achieved all
                      there was to achieve in this magazine as well</small><small>.
                      There is a 4-page interview with a </small><small> Piranha
                      available to give you an idea of what distinguishes this

                      reflect a whole new attitude towards life</small><small>.
