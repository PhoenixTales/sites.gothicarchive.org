                      comments</small><small>: Hi there. I've been playing this
                      fantasy RPG from Germany for </small><small> 6 hours now,
                      and I'm floored</small><small>.
Gothic's atmosphere and mood are unlike anything I've experienced since </small><small> Ultima Underworld
                      or System Shock. The world's alive</small><small>, the
                      graphics are incredible. </small><small> (I'm playing with
                      </small><small>Elsa's 3D Revelator Brille and it just
                      looks </small><small> sooooooo cool ...) The engine's very
                      fast and has greatly improved since the demo</small><small> [Athlon 1000 + Geforce2,
                      256 RAM</small><small>, 1024*786 32 Bit, line of sight</small><small>
                      300 (crazy!</small><small>), stereo drivers activated (which
                      weakens the frame rate by another </small><small> 30%), and
                      yet the Upperworld is smooth and completely fluid</small><small>!!
                      Phew! My compliments to </small><small> Piranha Bytes' C
                      programmers</small><small>. The German voice-overs are
                      professional and will take some beating </small><small>in
                      this g</small><small>enre. I also like the mouse control</small><small>,
                      and once you get used to the control as a whole</small><small>,
                      everything runs smoothly</small><small>. The fight system </small><small>isn'</small><small>t
                      quite so cool as on </small><small> Severance of Blade,
                      but it's good</small><small>. But the most unbelievably
                      cool thing about the game is the world itself</small><small>.
                      It's captivatingly credible and sucks you in</small><small>.
                      I've been roaming about the mountains for hours, I've been
                      watching and gathering experience</small><small>. When you
                      stand on one of those mountains and it starts to rain, you
                      really get the shivers ... and you can practically smell
                      the rain.</small><small> As you may have noticed, I am
                      greatly impressed</small><small>, and I quite honestly
                      wouldn't have believed that the boys and girls at </small><small> Piranha Bytes
                      would make it</small><small>. Thanks</small><small> for
                      the game and I hope you have a lot of economic success.
                      Regards from</small><small> Lothar
