    <b>Hints regarding sound cards:</b><br><br>
	

    All Windows compatible sound cards ought to run without problems with Gothic.
    Should problems still occur, try updating your drivers. Installing the
    latest drivers will often solve most problems caused in
    connection with new hardware</small><small>.<br><br>

    If Gothic still won't launch when the sound is activated, set the entry &quot;sndEnabled&quot;
    in the GOTHIC.INI file to &quot;0&quot; and see whether this corrects the problem.<br><br><br>

             DirectMusic system that Gothic employs generates the
            music in real time using a large variety of
            combinations. These are mixed to create the music
            track, a process that is ideally hardware supported (i.e.
            supported by the sound card). The currently available
            sound cards (e.g. Sound Blaster Live)
            are capable of mixing a sufficient amount of voices,
            whereas older cards may not have a sufficient range available. In
            this case, the CPU will have to do the mixing, which slows the game
            down. In the worst case, the CPU may be so busy
            with the music (if the sound card is incapable of
            dealing with it) that the game may become completely
            stuck. The only thing you can do about that is to
            purchase a later sound card or deactivate the music in Gothic's Audio
            menu.</small>
