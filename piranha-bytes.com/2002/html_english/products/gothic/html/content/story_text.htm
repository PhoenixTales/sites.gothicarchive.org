                        Before every battle goes peace. A tense peace. The kind of peace you experience before a hurricane. For a
                        short moment, time seemed to stand still. The air descended upon the ground like a dense, oppressive sheet of dust.<br><br>
						
                        Howling voices broke into the silence, and
                        the Orcs swept across the land like a tornado,<br>
                        ready to mow down anything and everything that might stand in
                        their way.<br>
                        The soldiers' arrows found their mark, dragging the huge
                        bodies down to the ground, but each gap was
		
	<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	
                        filled as quickly as it had emerged. <br><br>
						
						The war against the Orcs took its toll, and the prisoners of the Realm were to pay the price.<br><br>
						
						In the days that followed, every man guilty of a crime, no matter how insignificant an offence it may
						have been,

                        <small>was brought to the m</small><small>ining colony of Khorinis to gather ore for the king's arsenal.<br>
						The ovens' fires burned day and night and from the smithies rang a constant hammering.<br><br>
						
                        </small><small>
						
    The huge smelting furnace generates enormous heat in the mine. </small><small>
    The men work day and night,
    </small><small><br>
                        hewing the valuable ore from the impenetrable rock.<br><br>
						
                        The king assembled the twelve most powerful Mages </small><small>of
                        the Realm</small><small>: </small><small>six from the
                        Circle of Water</small><small> and </small><small>six
                        from the</small><small><br>
                        Circle of Fire. </small><small>He ordered them to erect
                        a magic barrier around the </small><small>mining colony
                        of </small><small> Khorinis, in order</small>
		
	<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	
                        <small>to put an end to the </small><small>countless
                        attempts at escaping</small><small>.<br>
                        The barrier would let all living beings </small><small>in</small><small>,
                        but none of them would be able to leave.<br><br>
						
                        Lightning tore the heavens, and </small><small>the
                        streams of magic merged like </small><small>an</small><small>
                        explosion. The barrier had been created,&nbsp;</small><p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><small>but
    it covered a much </small><small>wider area than planned</small><small>. </small><small>Even
    the Mages themselves were trapped inside it</small><small>.<br><br>

    </small><small>A brief moment of </small><small>negligence was all the convicts
    needed.<br>
    As the barrier crept across the sky, </small><small>they grasped the
    opportunity of </small><small>killing </small><small>the guards </small><small>that
    had been</small><p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><small>trapped
    inside the barrier with </small><small>them</small><small>. </small><small>Anyone
    who stood in the way of their </small><small>taking control of the</small><p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><small>area
    enclosed by the</small><small> </small><small>barrier </small><small>was
    killed</small><small>.<br><br>
						
    </small><small>The only ones they did </small><small>not dare to touch were
    the Mages</small><small>, </small><small>but even they were unable to </small><small>quell
    the uprising</small><small>.</small><p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><small>The
    entire stretch of land was now controlled by the prisoners</small><small>.<br><br>
						
    The king had no choice: He had to negotiate, </small><small>he needed the
    ore</small><small>.<br>
    He was forced to write a missive offering the convicts a deal. </small><small>He
    sent a messenger</small><small><br>
    to deliver the letter to the edge of the barrier and throw it </small><small>to
    one of the prisoners</small><small><br>
    </small><small>within the dome</small><small>.<br><br>
						
    This letter marked the birth of an agreement </small><small>that was to </small><small>prove
    successful in the end</small><small>.<br><br>
						
    Some of the prisoners continued to mine the valuable ore for the king. Once
    a month they<br>
    </small><small>sent </small><small>the gathered </small><small>ore to </small><small>a
    certain exchange place on the edge of the barrier</small><small>, where it
    was loaded onto a</small><p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><small>cable
    railway and </small><small>transported</small><small> outside.<br><br>
						
    In return, the king sent them all they asked for. Month after month he&nbsp;<br>
    </small><small>made sure that food and goods of all kinds</small><small> </small><small>were
    transported to the </small><small>barrier</small><small>. </small><small>Sometimes
    he even</small><small><br>
    </small><small>sent women </small><small>down into the barrier</small><small>.<br><br>
						
    </small><small>Today, yet another condemned man </small><small>is being
    taken to the mine</small><small>. </small><small>You are that man</small><small>.<br>
    </small><small>Just another convict</small><small>, doomed to spend the rest
    of his life trapped inside the barrier.<br>
    At least, that's what they think ...<br><br>
						
    The verdict is read out on a cliff </small><small>close to the</small><small>
    </small><small>exchange place</small><small>, </small><small>then you are </small><small>roughly
    shoved</small><small><br>
    </small><small>over the edge</small><small>. You lose consciousness as you </small><small>fall
    through the barrier</small><small>.<br>
    As </small><small>consciousness returns</small><small>, </small><small>you
    discover that you have landed in a lake</small><small>.<br>
    </small><small>Summing up your energy</small><small>, you reach the shore</small><small>.<br><br>
						
    A heavy foot stomps through the mud in front of you. </small><small>You look
    up</small><small>. </small><small>A few of the convicts</small><p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><small>are
    looking down at you, their arms crossed</small><small>.<br>
    The man directly opposite you </small><small>bends down</small><small>, </small><small>looks
    you full in the face </small><small>and remarks </small><small>with a
    stinking breath</small><small>:<br><br>
	
    </small><b>&quot;Welcome to jail!"</b><small><br><br>
	
    He rams his fist into your face and the world goes black ...
