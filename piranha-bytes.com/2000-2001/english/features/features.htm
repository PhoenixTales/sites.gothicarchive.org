        <td width="79%" valign="bottom"><p>&quot;Of course we are all role-playing-freaks 
            at Piranha Bytes. That's why we believe everyone should be able 
            to enjoy a game, not just the specialists among us: Oh, character 
            generation. Hmm, should I choose 'herd sheep' or 'glumpf resistance 
            level 1'? What is glumpf resistance? How the hell should I know!!</p>
            <p>In GOTHIC you don't have to determine everything before you start. 
            Get to know the world a little before you have to decide: &quot;You 
            want to learn sorcery, eh? No problem son, just bring this message 
            to the Necromancer and come back with his answer. If, err, when 
            you get back, I'll teach you what you want to know.&quot;</td>

<p>...Did anyone say it would be easy......?</p>
<p>We have taken great care to make the game control as easy as possible - you 
won't have to slog through thousands of menu screens, or have to keep a constant 
eye on a mass of character statistics. After all, it's much more fun to concentrate 
on the story and the world around you without being thrown off course by a few 
numbers.</p>
<p>Even though GOTHIC manages to survive without loads of menu screens and hundreds 
of character statistics, it will be no Action-RPG where RPG means that you get 
to open doors with golden keys instead of key-cards and kill orcs instead of 
super mutants.<br></p>

    <tr>
        <td width="95%" align="right" valign="bottom"><p>&quot;It's important 
            for us to give the player optical feedback. Meaning, when a player 
            wants to advance his abilities there are no meaningless numbers 
            merely increasing from 67 to 68 but the effect of the skills you 
            have learnt are visible in your character.&quot;</p>
            <p>For example, at the beginning of the game every character will 
            chop about with his sword like a lumber jack would do with his axe; 
            if he trains sword fighting with a master of the sword, you will 
            actually see the improvements: His fighting moves will become quicker 
            and more accurate. Alone the way he holds his weapon will not go 
            unnoticed.</td>

<p align="right">These &quot;optical&quot; improvements are for the whole range 
of skills included in GOTHIC. The two different classes of magic (which are 
absolutely independent from one another) work along the same lines.</p>
<p align="right">The untrained fireball from the normal magic class would just 
about manage to light a cigarette - for those among us who are not subject to 
this craving - a candle ;-) - with suitable training, however, you can cast 
&quot;surface fire&quot; with a mere wiggle of your fingers. In the psionic 
magic class you will soon see what happens if you try to control a monster, 
whose psychic abilities are far beyond yours...... BIG mistake!</p>
<p align="right">For armour and weapons of every kind there is also the WYSIWYG 
- principal: - if you've had a spot of luck and happen to have found the &quot;blood 
red axe of death&quot;, you'll naturally want to try it out. As soon as you 
equip a weapon, it can be found on the character's back and in his hand when 
fighting. Also clothing, armour and helmets are pictured exactly on every character, 
so that you know at a glance if it's a good idea to draw your sword against 
the steel-plate armoured veteran soldier when you're wearing a leather vest 
and a silk cap. Due to these visual effects we have decided to use the third 
person view for GOTHIC. The player has a constant eye on his character and knows 
at a glance which armour, weapons and skills he has, without having to rummage 
through all sorts of menu screens and numbers. <br></p>

<p class="Standard" style="margin:0px; padding:0px;">The social structure of 
GOTHIC brings the world to life. The inhabitants will reprove you if you do 
something wrong and help you if you help them. But they also have enemies, that 
think differently.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="margin:0px; padding:0px;">What you do matters, it 
makes a difference to the inhabitants and to life as you know it......</p>

    <tr>
        <td width="96%"><p align="right">&quot;What really sucks in other games 
            is the way the monsters behave. You turn the corner and you see 
            a statue of a monster waiting to be triggered off either when he 
            sees you or when you shoot at him. So, all day they do nothing more 
            but stand around waiting for death, huh?</p>
            <p align="right">Wrong! Monsters have a right to a private life! 
            They talk to each other, play games or simply sit around cleaning 
            their toe nails. When you turn the corner in GOTHIC that is what 
            you'll see: An orc sitting on the floor playing with his feet. He 
            sees you, jumps up, roars at you, grabs his battleaxe (read: picks 
            it up from the floor!) and goes for you!</td>

<p align="right">And another thing I just can't stand anymore: Hidden keys. 
You reach a vast portal which you can only gape at because you don't have the 
&quot;red key-card&quot; and have to fight your way through a boring extra level 
where, at the end (surprise, surprise ) you find the key you need! In GOTHIC 
you can simply knock the door down if you want to go through it, of course the 
monsters will hear you, and may even be attracted by the noise you make.</p>
<p align="right">In general the question isn't how to get through the door, 
but how to get past the monsters.<br>
You are unable to swim through the underground stream, because of a dangerously 
hungry water beast lurking in the depths? No problem, kill a goblin - his favourite 
snack, and throw it into the water, the water beast is pre-occupied and you 
can get past him.</p>
<p align="right">You're not the only one who can throw goblins either, the giant 
cave dwellers grab the goblins to throw them over obstacles or simply over your 
head to attack you from behind. The monsters in GOTHIC are all somehow linked 
to one another. Some hate the sight of each other, others work together. This 
way you can conquer some monsters by luring them into the hands of their enemy. 
A goblin, running to escape, will try to lure you into a trolls lair, to attack 
you anew with the troll at his side.</p>
<p align="right">To be able to interact with monsters in that way, we have given 
them all certain fears and favourites but also individual perception. Some can 
be lured with food or noise, some will run away from bright light. Some can 
only hear or detect movement. Every Monster has his own strengths and weaknesses, 
which are there to find. Whoever dares to blunder into every fight chopping 
his way through monsters ten to the dozen, will soon find the tables turned 
- on himself !<br></p>
