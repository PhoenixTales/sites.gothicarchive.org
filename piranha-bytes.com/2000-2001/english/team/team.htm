<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>THE COMPANY</strong></font></p>
<p align="left">The company PIRANHA BYTES was founded on the 01.10.1997 by five 
members previously employed at Greenwood Entertainment Software GmbH. At the 
moment we consist of 40 individuals and a variety of freelance workers, with 
whom we have successfully worked with in the past.</p>
<p align="left">The constant improvement in data technology may make the world 
seem no larger than a village, but progress has it's disadvantages, shown in 
the constantly rising costs of software development. We want to prove that a 
smaller software company in the middle of Germany is quite able to produce games 
to satisfy the expectations of the world wide market.</p>
<p align="left">To reach this goal we believe it is most important to produce 
games which we want to play ourselves, games, that are fun, games, which every 
enthusiastic player craves for. These are PIRANHA BYTES ground rules for their 
first project, the 3D-realtime-action-fantasy-role-playing-game GOTHIC.</p>

<p>Computers have always had one use for me - games! It all started with the 
Commodore VC20, then the C64 through to the Atari ST and took me at long last 
to the &quot;Wintel&quot; world (sniff, that ST really was a system - unwrap 
it stick it in and play - heaven!). Programming games myself was even more fascinating 
and my first question as I was shown the VC20-Basic for the first time, was: 
How can I make that thing shoot? Then, it didn't take long for the first productions 
of shareware games&nbsp; to reach the market.</p>
<p>Out of mere boredom than anything else I threw myself into studying electro 
techniques while serving in the German Air Force. When I think about it I wasn't 
really bored there at all. Rather had a great time.</p>
<p>So it took a few years for me to start my first &quot;real&quot; job in the 
business of computer games. There had been the term &quot;Project management 
and writing design documents&quot; in the contract with Greenwood Entertainment. 
This sounded like a good start, so after 8 years I said &quot;adieu&quot; to 
the Air Force. Now a few years have rolled by, yet again, and I'm sat here at 
PIRANHA BYTES writing this text, wondering whether any of the people reading 
our web pages will ever reach this sentence. If so there's 99 'Rubbercredits', 
and a PIRANHA BYTES bravery award (mail to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010310082524/mailto:award@piranha-bytes.com">award@piranha-bytes.com</a>) 
in it for you.</p>

            <p>&quot;It all started with the ZX81 (Yep, that's a lo-----ong 
            time ago) and after that the Atari range. Programming was tried 
            but was also given up just as quickly, so I decided to become a 
            graphic designer. Finishing school was also on the menu which was 
            achieved without too much energy being wasted.</p>
            <p>After a training for a while in an advertising agency I had the 
            opportunity to explore the wide world of the Personal Computer. 
            The first attempts with the '3D Studio' proved that I was more or 
            less made for the job. (Thanks Gottfried!).</td>

<p>After a job as trainer for graphic programs I had the opportunity to work 
as a freelancer on a range of different games. Constantly delivering my graphic 
designs and never being able to put my genius ideas for concept and story to 
any use.</p>
<p>Now everything has changed. I still deal with the graphical side and animation, 
but am also able to dabble in the design of the game (which&nbsp; means there 
is suddenly twice the work as before ;-)&quot;</p>

            The door opened and my father stood in front of me, half asleep

            school the next morning, and that I should start thinking seriously 
            about my future, and should spend my time doing something more productive 
            with my life. I listened, and told him I'd think about it. He went

<p><em>Cool:<br>
</em>Pen &amp; paper role-playing games, playing computer throughout the night, 
indirect light, open-air parties-with loads of beer, cheap food, Ultima, Lucas 
Arts adventures, Douglas Adams, original English film versions, Star Trek, the 
film music from Conan, camp fires on the beach in the middle of the night, touring 
in your car through the USA, Live role-playing games (surrounded by unsuspecting 
strangers) and music to wake you up.</p>
<p><em>This sucks:<br>
</em>Reading newspapers, getting up early in the morning, the newest Schwarzenegger 
films, Hollywood happy ends (-uhghhh), dubious baddies, 100,000,000 telephone-sex 
numbers in every commercial break, Bureaucracy, flying simulation games, discos 
that are jammed packed, mentally disturbed MTV show hosts, half-intelligent 
women, the pope, and everyone that likes anything of the above!&quot;</p>

<p>After a few &quot;trial &amp; error&quot; experiences in the most very different 
areas e.g. economical studies, the German Army, barkeeper, printer-technical 
studies, bouncer, industrial graphics, software trainer and media designer I 
have now eventually landed where I've always wanted to be anyway<br>
to GAMES! Yeah, good job!</p>
<p>Otherwise I'm still in grieving about most of the things that have made my 
life worth living: Awesome discos that have been closed down: LOGO, LURIE, bands 
that have been ripped apart like the DEAD KENNEDIES or DEVO and some that seem 
they should have given up a long time ago: SISTERS OF MERCY or THE CURE for 
example. And, last but not least, Star Trek captains that have managed to forget 
about the prime directive but don't sit snivelling over their knitting, feeling 
sorry for themselves.</p>
<p>But, for those who are getting depressed, here's a good tip: shove RAMMSTEIN 
in the car radio, visit the cocktail bar FREUDENPARK in N&uuml;rnberg, Germany 
, and order yourself a HORRORWATY from the menu....... after the first everything 
parties with you and after the second it just doesn't matter!!&quot;</p>

Before the PIRANHAS &quot;bit&quot; me, I had wasted four years of my life in-front 
of a machine cutting plastic, then a year doing A-Levels, and if that wasn?t 
enough I had to spend a few months in a summer camp for amateurs and take part 
in various trekking trips: Y-Tours.......you just don?t want to know the rest.<br>
After contacting PB at long last, I took a trip to sunny Bochum and before I 
could say &quot;Zapperdongflabberadap&quot; I had a few sketches of wild monsters 
in my hand and someone tapping me on the shoulder saying &quot; Just do it&quot;, 
so I did it, and if you?re able to read this now then they must have liked it. 
At the moment I spend my days (and sometimes nights) modelling monsters and

<p>After I got my A-Levels in a monastic school (funny, isn?t it?), I did an 
apprenticeship as a brewer partly in this region and partly in the south of 
Germany.<br>

it just lacked contact with the public.<br>
After a job-training as a programmer I did a practical placement with PIRANHAs 
and really felt at home here. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Since I hate the usual <i>I like and I don?t likes</i> I will only 
mention here that my second heart (besides the one I?ve got for computer-games)

<p align="left">My main task is composing a dynamic music, which underlines 
the actions of the players and the environmental effects. After certain team-mates 
have knocked back my pieces of art, (&quot;Why not jungle drums or piccolo-flutes 
during the fight?!?&quot;), we now agree more or less about music style, which 
is a major advance so far!<br>
I am working with curious means in order to produce sounds with a realistic 
touch. Did you know that you just have to squash a potato next to a microphone 
to obtain a more or less realistic sound of &quot;intestines that are squeezed 
out of an abdomen&quot;? <br>

At the moment I am still at school, but in summer 1999 I should have completed 
my A-Levels. After that I'll do my alternative service (u&auml;h!) and then 
I'll study a course of media informatics. <br>
My &quot;first time&quot; with a computer was ten years ago, when I got a C64 
as a present. <br>
Since I was really into &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; and the Commodore-Basic, 
I fell more and more in love with the computer: my first small game appeared 
soon. (I have named it &quot;Wannabe-Breakout&quot;) Some years later I did 
the small step from the C64 to the 486, where a whole range of new possibilities 
were awaiting me.<br>
At the same time I got more and more interested in graphics and in music, so 
there's no doubt that I was born to be a freak of games: the development of 
a computer-game includes all creative parts that I like to work on. <br>
<br>
I like: <br>
Computer-games and music (You wouldn't have known that by now!), graphics, programming, 
soul, &quot;Domian&quot;, to have a long lie-in (don't often get the chance), 
food, &lt;censored&gt;, extroverted and honest people <br>
<br>
What makes me sick:<br>
&quot;general protection fault...&quot;, my pedagogy teacher, colds and flu, 
half-heartedly published computer-games and endlessly postponed release dates 
(just take this last point out, if the game is more than half a year late.)</p>
